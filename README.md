# bindED

This VoiceAttack plugin reads keybindings in Elite:Dangerous and stores them as
VoiceAttack variables. It was originally written by Gary (the developer of
VoiceAttack) [and published on the VoiceAttack
forums](https://forum.voiceattack.com/smf/index.php?topic=564.0). You can find
the [original README here](https://alterNERDtive.github.io/bindED/ReadMe.txt)
for reference.

I have basically done a complete rewrite of the original source code at this point
and added a lot of features including automatic detection of the correct
bindings file and support for non-US keyboard layouts (see below for details).
